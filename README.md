# yog.ai
Capstone Project: Summer 2023

This repository houses the code for our application, yog.AI. The structure is as follows:
- `website` contains the code for the production of the website locally and when deployed to our domain `yogai.co`. Additionally, the  `server` contains the code necessary to run our flask application
-   - this directory contains the pickled model files for each custom model for each face yoga pose our application allows for testing
    - this directory also contains the `script.js` which connects our back-end (flask server) to front-end UI
- `data` contains our intial EDA on our scraped dataset of facial yoga pose frames
